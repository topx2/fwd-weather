Udacity Project 2 for Weather Jornal from API
# Weather-Journal App Project

This repository is for the Weather Journal App project for Front End Web Development Proffesional track by FWD and Udacity

I used the starter project found [here](https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019/projects/weather-journal-app)

# Instructions

This will require modifying the server.js file and the website/app.js file. You can see index.html for element references,
 and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use style.css to style your application to customized perfection.



This project uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Node JS to create a web page that runs on a local server.
You'll have to download Express, Body-Parser and CORS.
